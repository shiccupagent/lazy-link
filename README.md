# render-link

Let Claude Code on your Mac use your Windows gaming PC's NVIDIA graphics card for local AI:
**images, sound effects and music, 3D models, a chat model, and speech-to-text.**
You type (or Claude writes) a prompt on the Mac; the PC does the work; the files come back.
No cloud bill and no per-image quota. The PC stays your PC: jobs run invisibly under a separate
locked-down account, and nothing on it listens to anything except your Mac on your home network.

```
Mac (Claude Code)                                   Windows PC (NVIDIA GPU)
  imagegen.py / local.py                              hidden standard account "render"
  pcjob run JOB  ── SSH, your key only ───────▶       job runner (scheduled task), one job at a time
                 ◀── results folder ─────────         ComfyUI (images, sound, 3D) · llama.cpp · Whisper
  pcjob wake (Wake-on-LAN) / pcjob sleep              everything lives in C:\render
```

Speeds we measured on an RTX 3090: a 1-megapixel image in 3-15 s, a sound effect in about 2 s,
a textured 3D model in 2.5-8.5 min, and a chat model writing about 200 tokens (roughly 150 words) per second.

## What you need
- A Mac with Claude Code (or any Mac/Linux terminal with `python3` 3.9+ and `ssh`).
- A Windows 10/11 PC with an NVIDIA GPU (12 GB of video memory or more is comfortable; 24 GB runs
  everything here), an up-to-date NVIDIA driver, and 40-100 GB free disk for models.
- Both on the same home network. A network **cable** on the PC if you want the Mac to wake it.

## Setup (about 15 minutes, plus downloads)
1. **Mac:** download this repo, open Terminal in its folder, run `./install-mac.sh`.
   It makes a key that lets this Mac (and only this Mac) into the PC.
2. **PC:** copy the same folder over (USB stick, or download the repo again there), then
   double-click **`pc\Setup-PC.cmd`** and click *Yes* on the admin prompt. It is the only step
   that needs admin. Want to see first what it changes? Run `Setup-PC.cmd -DryRun`.
3. **Mac:** run the line the PC shows at the end, e.g. `./mac/pcjob pair 192.168.1.50`.
   Check that the fingerprint matches the one on the PC's screen and answer `y`.
4. **Mac:** install the AI tools onto the PC (no admin needed, all into `C:\render`):
   ```bash
   ./imagegen/imagegen.py setup          # ComfyUI + Python + PyTorch (about 5 GB)
   ./imagegen/imagegen.py sizes          # what each model downloads, and its licence
   ./imagegen/imagegen.py fetch --models krea2 --recipes audio
   ./local/local.py setup                # chat models + Whisper (about 35 GB)
   ```

## Use it
```bash
./imagegen/imagegen.py one "a red ceramic mug, product photo" --out out/ --cutout
./imagegen/imagegen.py run imagegen/examples/images.json --out out/          # many at once
./imagegen/imagegen.py make audio imagegen/examples/sounds.json --out out/   # sounds / music
./imagegen/imagegen.py make mesh imagegen/examples/mesh.json --out out/      # picture -> 3D (.glb)
./imagegen/imagegen.py preview out/                                          # 3D turntable pictures (needs Blender on the PC)
./local/local.py ask-one "Explain Wake-on-LAN in two sentences"
./local/local.py ask local/examples-asks.jsonl --out out/
./local/local.py transcribe talk.m4a --out out/                              # .txt, .srt, word timings
./mac/pcjob run my-job-folder --fetch out/                                   # anything else: a folder with a job.ps1
```
Or just ask Claude Code in this folder: *"make me 10 coin sounds"*. [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) tells it how.

**Batch your asks.** Each job spends 15-55 s starting ComfyUI or loading a model; after that, every
extra image or answer is quick. One job with 50 asks beats 50 jobs with one.

## Safety, in plain words
- **A separate, hidden, standard account** (`render`) runs every job. It is not an administrator,
  can't sign in at the keyboard, and its password is random and never shown.
- **Key only.** SSH accepts only your Mac's key, only for `render`. Passwords are switched off.
- **Home network only.** The firewall opens port 22 only on networks Windows calls *Private*, and
  only to addresses on your own home network. ComfyUI and the chat model listen on 127.0.0.1 (the
  PC itself), never the network.
- **Your PC, your rules.** `pcjob sleep` refuses while someone is signed in and using the PC.
  A job that woke the PC puts it back to sleep afterwards, and only then.
- **Undo:** double-click `pc\Undo-PC.cmd` (add `-RemoveWorkFolder -RemoveOpenSSH` to remove everything).

## Licences of the models (check before you sell what you make)
| Use | Model | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| Images (default) | Krea 2 Turbo | Krea 2 Community: free while yearly revenue < $1M |
| Images, quick / any use | FLUX.2 klein 4B, Z-Image Turbo | Apache-2.0 |
| Transparent cutouts | BiRefNet | MIT |
| Sounds and music | Stable Audio 3 (small / medium) | Stability AI Community: free while yearly revenue < $1M |
| Picture to 3D | Pixal3D + TRELLIS.2 | MIT |
| Chat | Qwen3-30B-A3B, gpt-oss-20b | Apache-2.0 |
| Speech-to-text | Whisper large-v3 (faster-whisper) | MIT |

Every file comes from the maker's official repository (or ComfyUI's official repack) and is checked
against its size and sha256 before use. This repo's own code is MIT.
